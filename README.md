# 🎵 SQL Music Store Analysis (Chinook Database Project)

This project contains a full SQL analysis of the **Chinook Music Store Database**.  
The database includes information about customers, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, and genres.  
I used SQL to explore the data and extract useful insights such as top customers, most popular music genres, highest revenue cities, and more.
